  # The general guidelines for all your short-form posts are:
  # Add your username to the author section
  # The title will also be the page title, and the document title will appear in the url address
  # The short text could be a quote, a question, a shower thought, anything really
  # quote-ref is optional, it explains the text. It could be a quote source, a location, a hashtag...
  # citation is optional and is only for quote links
  # As for all posts, you can add optional categories and tags

"But as I’ve grown, I’ve found that’s hardly the end of the story. I’ve started to get good at leading a conversation or cracking people up with a joke. I like telling stories at a party a story or buzzing about a room saying ‘hi’ to people. I get a rush from it! Sure, I’m still not the most party-oriented person I know, but I no longer think we fit into any neat introversion/extroversion buckets."
