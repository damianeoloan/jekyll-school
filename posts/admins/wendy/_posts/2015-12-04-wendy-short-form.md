  # The general guidelines for all your short-form posts are:
  # Add your username to the author section
  # The title will also be the page title, and the document title will appear in the url address
  # The short text could be a quote, a question, a shower thought, anything really
  # quote-ref is optional, it explains the text. It could be a quote source, a location, a hashtag...
  # citation is optional and is only for quote links
  # As for all posts, you can add optional categories and tags
