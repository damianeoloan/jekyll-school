  # The general guidelines for all your short-form posts are:
  # Add your username to the author section
  # The title will also be the page title, and the document title will appear in the url address
  # The short text could be a quote, a question, a shower thought, anything really
  # quote-ref is optional, it explains the text. It could be a quote source, a location, a hashtag...
  # citation is optional and is only for quote links
  # As for all posts, you can add optional categories and tags

"Let’s say you really want to get in shape, but never remember to exercise. You can keep beating yourself up for your forgetfulness, or you can put a system in place. Maybe you have your roommate check to see that you exercise before you leave your house in the morning or you set a regular time to consistently go to the gym together. Life isn’t a high school exam; you don’t have to solve your problems on your own."
