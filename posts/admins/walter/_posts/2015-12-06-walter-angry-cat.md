  # The general guidelines for all your image posts are:
  # Add your username to the author section
  # The title will also be the page title, and the document title will appear in the url address
  # You'll need to save the image in the folder as you describe for img-path, or you could link to a cloud storage service like Dropbox
  # The image description is necessary in case the image doesn't appear properly, and means people who can't see can access the information
  # The caption can say whatever you like. If it gets too long, consider using a long-form post
  # As for all posts, you can add optional categories and tags
